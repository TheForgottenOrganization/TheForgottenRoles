# Roles

## Role Assignment
We are still improving the role assignment system. It's not that intuitive right now, but it's more flexible than the older one
if you're using it right.

First you need to choose how many special roles of each kind (Impostor/Neutral/Crewmate) you want in the game.
The count you set will only be reached, if there are enough Crewmates/Impostors in the game and if enough roles are set to be in the game (i.e. they are set to > 0%). The roles are then being distributed as follows:
- First all roles that are set to 100% are being assigned to arbitrary players
- After that each role that has 10%-90% selected adds 1-9 tickets to a ticket pool (there exists a ticket pool for Crewmates, Neutrals and Impostors). Then the roles will be selected randomly from the pools as long it's possible (until the selected number is reached, until there are no more Crewmates/Impostors or until there are no more tickets). If a role is selected from the pool, obviously all the tickets of that role are being removed.
- The Mafia, Lovers and Mini are being selected independently (without using the ticket system) according to the spawn chance you selected. After that the Crewmate, Neutral and Impostor roles are selected and assigned in a random order.

**Example:**\
Settings: 2 special Crewmate roles, Snitch: 100%, Hacker: 10%, Tracker: 30%\
Result: Snitch is assigned, then one role out of the pool [Hacker, Tracker, Tracker, Tracker] is being selected\
Note: Changing the settings to Hacker: 20%, Tracker: 60% would statistically result in the same outcome .


## Mafia
### **Team: Impostors**
The Mafia are a group of three Impostors.\
The Godfather works like a normal Impostor.\
The Mafioso is an Impostor who cannot kill nor sabotage until the Godfather is dead.\
The Janitor is an Impostor who cannot kill nor sabotage, but they can hide dead bodies instead.\
\
**NOTE:**
- There have to be 3 Impostors activated for the mafia to spawn.

### Game Options

## Morphling
### **Team: Impostors**

\
**NOTE:**
- They shrink to the size of the Mini when they copies its look.
- The Hacker sees the new color on the admin table.
- The color of the footprints changes accordingly (also the ones that were already on the ground).
- The other Impostor still sees that they are an Impostor (the name remains red).
- The shield indicator changes accordingly (the Morphling gains or loses the shield indicator)
- Tracker and Snitch arrows keep working.

### Game Options

## Vampire  
![Vampire](./Images/roles/vampire.png)
### **Team: Impostors**

If the Vampire spawn chance is greater 0 (even if there is no Vampire in the game), all players can place one garlic.\
If a victim is near a garlic, the "Bite Button" turns into the default "Kill Button" and the Vampire can only perform a normal kill.\
\
**NOTE:**
- If a bitten player is still alive when a meeting is being called, he dies at the start of the meeting.
- The cooldown is the same as the default kill cooldown (+ the kill delay if the Vampire bites the target).

The erase will be performed, even if the Eraser or his target die before the next meeting.\
By default the Eraser can erase everyone but the Spy and other Impostors. Depending on the options
he can also erase them (Impostors will lose their special Impostor ability).
\
**NOTE:**
- The Shifter shift will always be triggered before the Erase (hence either the new role of the Shifter will be erased or the Shifter saves the role of his target, depending on who the Eraser erased)
- Erasing a Lover automatically erases the other Lover as well (if the second Lover is an ImpLover, he will turn into an Impostor)
- Erasing a Jackal that has a Sidekick, triggers the Sidekick promotion if it's activated in the settings
- As the erasing is being triggered before the eject of a player, erasing and voting out a Lover in the same round, would result in the
ex Lover surviving as the partnership was erased before. Also a Jester win would not happen, as the erase will be triggered before.

### Game Options

boxes dosn't have animation.

If one of the Lovers is a killer (i.e. Jackal/Sidekick/Impostor), they can achieve a "Lovers solo win" where only the Lovers win.\

The Shift will always be performed at the end of the next meeting right before a player is exiled. The target needs to be chosen during the round.\
Even if the Shifter or the target dies before the meeting, the Shift will still be performed.\
Swapping roles with an Impostor or Neutral fails and the Shifter commits suicide after the next meeting (there won't be any body).\
The Shifter aims to save roles from leaving the game, by e.g. taking over a Sheriff or Medic that is known to the Impostors.\
This works especially well against the Eraser, but also gives the Eraser the possiblity to act like a Shifter.\
The **special interactions** with the Shifter are noted in the chapters of the respective roles.\
\
**NOTE:**
- The Shifter shift will always be triggered before the Erase (hence either the new role of the Shifter will be erased or the Shifter saves the role of his target, depending on who the Eraser erased)
- If the Shifter takes over a role, their new cooldowns will start at the maximum cooldown of the ability
- One time use abilities (e.g. shielding a player or Engineer sabotage fix) can only used by one player in the game (i.e. the Shifter
can only use them, if the previous player did not used them before)

### Game Options
| Name | Description
|----------|:-------------:|

## Time Master
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Time Master has a time shield which he can activate. The time shield remains active for a configurable amount of time.\
If a player trys to kill the Time Master while the time shield is active, the kill won't happen and the
time will rewind for a set amount of time.\
The kill cooldown of the killer won't be reset, so the Time Master
has to make sure that the game won't result in the same situation.\
The Time Master won't be affected by the rewind.\
\
**NOTE:**
- Only the movement is affected by the rewind
- A Vampire bite will trigger the rewind. If the Time Master misses shielding the bite, he can still shield the kill which happens a few seconds later.
- If the Time Master was bitten and has his shield active before when a meeting is called, he survives but the time won't be rewinded.
- If the Time Master has a Medic shield, he won't rewind.
- The shield itself ends immediately when triggered. So the timemaster can be attacked again as soon as the rewind ends.

## Bait
### **Team: Crewmates**

Created by  [MallÃ¶ris](https://github.com/Mallaris)\

The Bait is a Crewmate that if killed, forces the killer to self report the body (you can configure a delay in the options).
Additionally, the Bait can see if someone is inside a vent (depending on the options the exact vent gets
an outline or all vents do).

**NOTE:**
- If there is a Seer in the game, there can't be a Bait


### Game Options
| Name | Description
|----------|:-------------:|
| Bait Spawn Chance | -
| Bait Highlight All Vents | If set to true, all vents will be highlighted if a player is inside of one of them. If set to false, only the vents where players are siting in will be highlighted.
| Bait Report Delay | -

## Jackal
### **Team: Jackal**
The Jackal is part of an extra team, that tries to eliminate all the other players.\
The Jackal has no tasks and can kill Impostors, Crewmates and Neutrals.\
The Jackal (if allowed by the options) can select another player to be his Sidekick.
Creating a Sidekick removes all tasks of the Sidekick and adds him to the team Jackal. The Sidekick loses his current role (except if he's a Lover, then he plays in two teams).
The "Create Sidekick Action" may only be used once per Jackal or once per game (depending on the options).
The Jackal can also promote Impostors to be his Sidekick, but depending on the options the Impostor will either really turn into the Sidekick and leave the team Impostors or he will just look like the Sidekick to the Jackal an remain as he was.\
\
The team Jackal enables multiple new outcomes of the game, listing some examples here:
- The Impostors could be eliminated and then the crew plays against the team Jackal.
- The Crew could be eliminated, then the Team Jackal fight against the Impostors (the Crew can still make a task win in this scenario)

The priority of the win conditions is the following:
1. Crewmate Mini lose by vote
2. Jester wins by vote
3. Arsonist win
4. Team Impostor wins by sabotage
5. Team Crew wins by tasks (also possible if the whole Crew is dead)
6. Lovers among the last three players win
7. Team Jackal wins by outnumbering (When the team Jackal contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 Impostors left and team Jackal contains no Lover)
8. Team Impostor wins by outnumbering (When the team Impostors contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 players of the team Jackal left and team Impostors contains no Lover)
9. Team Crew wins by outnumbering (When there is no player of the team Jackal and the team Impostrs left)

**NOTE:**
- The Jackal (and his Sidekick) may be killed by a Sheriff.
- A Jackal cannot target the Mini, while it's growing up. After that he can kill it or select it as its Sidekick
- The Crew can still win, even if all of their members are dead, if they finish their tasks fast enough (that's why converting the last Crewmate with tasks left into a Sidekick results in a task win for the crew)

If both Impostors and Jackals are in the game the game continues even if all Crewmates are dead. Crewmates may still win in this case by completing their tasks. Jackal and Impostor have to kill each other.



### Game Options

If this option is set to "No" Jackal and Sidekick can kill each other ) |
| Jackal and Sidekick have Impostor vision | - |
-----------------------

## Sidekick
### **Team: Jackal**
Gets assigned to a player during the game by the "Create Sidekick Action" of the Jackal and joins the Jackal in his quest to eliminate all other players.\
Upon the death of the Jackal (depending on the options), he might get promoted to Jackal himself and potentially even assign a Sidekick of his own.
\
**NOTE:**
- A player that converts into a Sidekick loses his previous role and tasks (if he had one), except the Lover role.
- The Sidekick may be killed by a Sheriff.

-----------------------

## Spy
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Spy is a Crewmate, which has no special abilities.\
The Spy looks like an additional Impostor to the Impostors, they can't tell the difference.\
There are two possibilities (depending on the set options):
- The Impostors can't kill the Spy (because otherwise their kill button would reveal, who the Spy is)
- The Impostors can kill the Spy but they can also kill their Impostor partner (if they mistake another Impostor for the Spy)
You can set whether the Sheriff can kill the Spy or not (in order to keep the lie alive).

-----------------------

## Security Guard
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Security Guard is a Crewmate that has a certain amount of screws that he can use for either sealing vents or for placing new cameras.\
Placing a new camera and sealing vents takes a configurable amount of screws. The total number of screws that a Security Guard has can also be configured.\
The new camera will be visible after the next meeting and accessible by everyone.\
The vents will be sealed after the next meeting, players can't enter or exit sealed vents, but they can still "move to them" underground.\
**NOTE:**
- Tickster boxes can't be sealed
- The Security Guard can't place Cameras on MiraHQ
- The remaining number of screws can be seen above his special button
- On Skeld the four cameras will be replaced every 3 seconds (with the next four cameras). You can also navigate manually using the arrow keys.

# Custom Servers and 10+ Players
We always recommend you to play on custom servers rather than on the official ones. If you want to play with more than 10 players in one lobby, you're required to use a custom server. Credits for the original implementation that allowed 10+ player lobbies go to the creaters of the [CrowdedMod](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/CrowdedMod).

**Setup the Clients:**
1. Open the region menu where you can choose between the different regions
2. Select the region *Custom*
3. Enter the ip/domain and the port of your custom server in the corresponding text fields

**Setup the Server:**
1. Get the [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor) release for the Among Us version **2021.3.31 - 2021.4.2**
2. Follow the steps (using the server release you just downloaded) on the official [Impostor-Documentation](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor/wiki/Running-the-server)
3. Make sure to set the following values to false in the `config.json` file:
```
    ...
    "AntiCheat": {
      "Enabled": false,
      "BanIpFromGame": false
    }
```
4. Make sure to forward the right ports on the hosting machine
5. Run the server and setup the client

**Setting up Server as Docker Container:** \
If you want to run the server as a docker container you'll need to use the image
```
aeonlucid/impostor:nightly
```
(Currently only the "nightly" tag is starting a server supporting 2021.3.31 or later)

In addition to running it, the environment variables to disable the AntiCheat feature need to be set.
```
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__Enabled=false
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__BanIpFromGame=false
```

Example to docker run command:
```
docker run -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__Enabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__BanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly
```

Or use to run it in the background
```
docker run -d -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__Enabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__BanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly
```

# Custom Hats
## Create and submit new hat designs
We're awaiting your creative hat designs and we'll integrate all the good ones in our mod.
Here are a few instructions, on how to create a custom hat:

- **Creation:** A hat consists of up to three textures. The aspect ratio of the textures has to be `4:5`, we recommend `300px:375px`:
  - `Main texture (required)`:
    - This is the main texture of your hat. It will usually be rendered in front of the player, if you set the `behind` parameter it will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern *hatname.png*, but you can also set some additional parameters in the file name by adding `_parametername` to the file name (before the *.png*).
    - Parameter `bounce`: This parameter determines whether the hat will bounce while you're walking or not.
    - Parameter `adaptive`: If this parameter is set, the Among Us coloring shader will be applied (the shader that replaces some colors with the colors that your character is wearing in the game). The color red (#ff0000) will be replaced with the primary color of your player and the color blue (#0000ff) with the secondary color. Also other colors will be affected and changed, you can have a look at the texture of the [Crewmate Hat](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/among-us-wiki/images/e/e0/Crewmate_hat.png) to see how this feature should be used.
    - Parameter `behind`: If this parameter is set, the main texture will be rendered behind the player.
  - `Flipped texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Main texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_flip.png`.
  - `Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back.png`.
  - `Flipped Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Back texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back_flip.png`.
  - `Climb texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered in front of the player, when he's climbing.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_climb.png`.
- **Testing:** You can test your hat design by putting all the files in the `\TheOtherHats\Test` subfolder of your mod folder. Then whenever you start a freeplay game, you and all the dummies will be wearing the new hat. You don't need to restart Among Us if you change the hat files, just exit and reenter the freeplay mode.

- **Submission:** If you got a hat design, you can submit it on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/77RkMJHWsM). We'll look at all the hats and add all the good ones to the game.

It's bad I know, this is a side project and my second week of modding. So there are no best practices around here.
You can use parts of the code but don't copy paste the whole thing. Make sure you give credits to the other developers, because some parts of the code are based on theirs.
